                <p>
                    Recent graduate from the University of Washington, with a major in both Operations Management and
                    Information Systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am fascinated by technology and the capabilities it has to shape our world. At the same time, I am
                    constantly seeking to better understand the people around me. My goal is to bridge the gap between
                    these two worlds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've built a diverse skill-set to reach this goal. I am comfortable leading teams, and just as
                    comfortable diving into the back-end of a jumbled code base. I love communicating face-to-face with
                    clients, but I also value a day spent getting familiar with the latest Javascript library. A desire
                    for continual learning is what drives me - I value curiosity, hard work, and discipline, and try to
                    reflect these qualities in everything I do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am always looking for opportunities to challenge and grow my skills, both personally and
                    professionally. If you are of a similar mindset, I'd love to connect.
