                Hello -- welcome to my online portfolio! I am a recent graduate from the University of Washington, with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, focusing in Information Systems and Operations Management. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                After learning about the many managerial aspects of software development, I decided to take a hands-on approach to development and learn to create websites and applications of my own. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Software development is fascinating to me because of the creativity it gives developers, and the aesthetic influence they have over their projects. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                I am constantly looking to learn new things and grow as a person, which means that I have many passions aside from developing. Cooking, reading, improv comedy, and fitness are just a few of these, and balancing all of them is another full time hobby as well!
            </p>
